"""
Facilitate HTTP caching mechanisms.

This package contains the tooling required to (efficiently) apply and use ETag
HTTP headers.

On a request level, the API will return HTTP 304 statuses if the client has
an up to date version of the resource. It will reply with a HTTP 200 otherwise,
including the ETag header.

This package provides a model mixin to save the ETag header value to the db,
and a decorator to enable conditional requests on viewsets. The rest are
implementation details.
